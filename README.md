This is a plugin for NURDbot which is controls the local LanBox (www.lanbox.com)

It is designed to communicate over TCP to the lanbox, which then has an attached
DMX512 universe. Lights can be defined as sinle channel or multichannel via the
lightdata components, and profiles of lights can be stored using the lightprofile
components.
